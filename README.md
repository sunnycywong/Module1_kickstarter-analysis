<u> Outcomes Based on Goal chart <u> 
 
The Outcomes Based on Goal chart shows the successful and failed rates of the play events throughout the year is in parallel of each otherâ€™s opposite direction. From an outcome standpoint, they break even with each other. 
 
However, based on the successful rate, seems like goals that were less than $1,000 have a better outcome, and the $35,000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44,999 are the next groups with better successful rate. The goal amounts within the $45,000 to $49,999 have the less successful rate.
