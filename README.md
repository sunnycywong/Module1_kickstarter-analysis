# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## (1) Overview of Project
Provide Louise how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, as a reference for Louise to coming the fundraising goal for her play, Fever. 

## (2) Analysis and Challenges
<ins> Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date <ins>
 
Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart demonstrated May to July were the positive period with a higher successful rate. As it moved toward the end of the year, the level of successful got decreased.

<ins> Outcomes Based on Goal chart <ins>
 
The Outcomes Based on Goal chart shows the successful and failed rates of the play events throughout the year is in parallel of each other’s opposite direction. From an outcome standpoint, they break even with each other. 
 
However, based on the successful rate, seems like goals that were less than $1,000 have a better outcome, and the $35,000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44,999 are the next groups with better successful rate. The goal amounts within the $45,000 to $49,999 have the less successful rate.

The two above charts are not enough to provide the right level of details to Louise. As these charts are not referring exactly the same level of data. The Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart is only focusing on theatre events, whereas, the Outcomes Based on Goal chart was looking on the play events, which “play” is a subcategory of the theatre events. 
 
Since Louise is looking for data about “play”. Thus, I ran the Theater Pie Chart to check what is the percentage of play that takes place out of all the Theater event. As a result, it takes 76% of the theatre event. To ensure the viewing data are being aligned, I created the Plays Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart to cross reference with the Outcomes Based on Goal chart.

Moreover, the Outcomes Based on Goal chart is only showing the level of successful and failed, which may not be fully arcuate to show the actual successful population throughout the year. Therefore, I applied the conditional highlight on the original chart to check what was the highest number out of the successful and failed population.

## (3) Results
In conclusion, based on the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date chart. First,  May to July is a good period to launch with a good return out of successful rate. Secondly, October is not being recommended because it has the lowest successful rate and the highest failed rate. Furthermore, from October to December is not recommended, as we can see the gap in between the successful and failed rates is small, which means these months are at a higher risk to be successful.

Taking a deeper dive, by using the Plays Outcomes based on Launch Date. The analysis outcome is as same as the above by using the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date. When comparing these two charts, we can see the trends are pretty much the same.

The Outcomes Based on Goal chart shows the percentage of successful and failed is mirroring with each other. Taking a deeper dive, I looked into the data chart and noticed the $1,000 to $4,999 range has the most successful and failed amounts. With a total of 388 successful events and 146 failed events, which shows there is about a 160% chance of getting a successful event. Secondary would be the less than $1,000 group, which has 141 successful events and 45 failed events, which is a 200% chance of successful over failed.

Based on this analysis above setting the goal to be $4,999 or below and launching the event sometime in May to July would be ideal.
